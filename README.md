# Project Title: HTML CSS and Git Challenge: Code Refactoring
## Project Description:
This project intends to improve 
<b>   a) </b> accessability to previous developers' codes and 
    b) refactor the code for a logical flow. 
I improved the semantic text to 
    a) allow other project developers to better understand the placement of the project-related elements and 
    b) to follow a rational flow.  
This was designed using HTML, CSS and Github.
## How to Install and Run the Project:
This project can be pull from the repository via the git hub website by following the link:

## How to Use the Project:
This project can be used by the new developers to understand the fundamnetal values in the semantic HTML elements and logical flow, there-by increasing productivity and improving the structure of the websites.
