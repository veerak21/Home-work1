# Urban-Octo-Telegram
## Project Description:
This project intends to improve 
<b>   a) </b> accessability to previous developers' codes and 
 <b>  b) </b> refactor the code for a logical flow. 
I improved the semantic text to 
<b>   a) </b> allow other project developers to better understand the placement of the project-related elements and 
<b>   b) </b> to follow a rational flow.  
This was designed using HTML, CSS and Github.

## How to Install and Run the Project:

## How to Use the Project:
